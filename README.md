# **weedingsim**

A repo for my Weeding Simulator game. 

## Notice

New updates won't come very often as I do a ***lot*** of my coding offline.

I can't promise I'll be online to help you debug constantly but I'll try.

Alternatively, you can email me at robert@megley.com with the subject as 'priority'

## Release Plans

This game is still in development but it's slowly gaining features that allow for it to be more playable
Alpha versions will probably go all the way up to Alpha V3 and then it'll go into a beta stage and most likely a stable release soon after.

## Requirements

To run this you need Python3 and a few modules (see "How to Run" for details on how to install those).

## How to Run

Just clone the repo or download and unzip it and go to the folder in your terminal and enter the following:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
chmod +x main.py game.py
```
and to run it:
```
./main.py
```
