# weedingsim
A repo for my Weeding Simulator game. 

New updates won't come very often as I do a lot of my coding offline.

# Release plans

This game is still in development but it's slowly gaining features that allow for it to be more playable
Alpha versions will probably go all the way up to Alpha V3 and then it'll go into a beta stage and most likely a stable release soon after.

# How to Run

Just clone the repo or download and unzip it and go to the folder in your terminal and enter the following

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
chmod +x main.py game.py
```
and to run it:
`./main.py`
